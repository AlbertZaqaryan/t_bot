# t_bot

**t_bot** — A Python Telegram bot built using **pytelegrambotapi** and **Selenium WebDriver** for automation tasks.

---

##  Features

- Integrates with the Telegram Bot API via **pytelegrambotapi**
- Uses **Selenium WebDriver** to automate web tasks (e.g., scraping, navigation)
- Modular design using separate scripts (**bot.py**, **parser.py**)
- Custom trainers stored in **trainers.txt**

---

##  Getting Started

###  Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Telegram Bot API token — [Create a bot via BotFather on Telegram](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot)  
- WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver) compatible with your browser version

###  Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlbertZaqaryan/t_bot.git
   cd t_bot
````

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install pytelegrambotapi selenium
   ```

4. **Configure your bot:**

   * Open `bot.py` and insert your Telegram Bot token.
   * Ensure the WebDriver binary (e.g., `chromedriver`) is accessible—put it in your PATH or project root.

5. **Adjust or populate `trainers.txt`** if specific training data or keywords are expected for `parser.py`.

---

## Usage

Run the bot with:

```bash
python bot.py
```

Once running, your bot will listen for Telegram messages and respond (according to the logic implemented in `bot.py` and `parser.py`), potentially performing automated browser actions via Selenium.

| File           | Description                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bot.py`       | Main entry point — handles incoming messages and bot logic.     |
| `parser.py`    | Encapsulates parsing or web automation routines.                |
| `trainers.txt` | Stores custom data (e.g., keywords, training text).             |
| `.gitignore`   | Specifies ignored files/folders (e.g., `venv/`, `__pycache__/`) |

## Future Enhancements

* Implement command handlers (e.g., `/start`, `/help`, `/stats`)
* Add Selenium configurations (headless mode, timeout settings, browser selection)
* Enhance parser capabilities for diverse tasks (e.g., form submission, scraping)
* Include logging, error-handling, and configuration via environment variables
